# Phase 2: Core LDAP Operations - 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

## 🎯 **Phase 2 Goals**
Implement full LDAP search capabilities, advanced authentication, and schema validation to create a fully functional LDAP directory server.

## 📋 **Todo List Status**

### 🔐 **Authentication & Security**
- [x] **Simple bind authentication (username/password)** - ✅ Already implemented in Phase 1

### 🔍 **Advanced Search Operations** 
- [ ] **Complete search scope support (base, one-level, subtree)** - Extend search handlers for all scope types
- [ ] **LDAP filter parsing and evaluation** - Implement RFC 4515 filter syntax parser
- [ ] **Enhanced search result handling** - Support large result sets and paging controls
- [ ] **Search result caching** - Optimize performance for repeated queries

### 📐 **Schema & Data Management**
- [ ] **Basic schema validation** - Implement objectClass and attribute validation
- [ ] **LDIF data loading capabilities** - Load directory data from standard LDIF files
- [ ] **Schema constraint enforcement** - Validate required attributes and data types
- [ ] **Multi-valued attribute support** - Handle attributes with multiple values correctly

### 🔧 **Protocol Enhancement**
- [ ] **Proper error responses and LDAP result codes** - Return RFC-compliant error messages
- [ ] **Integration tests with real LDAP clients** - Test compatibility with Apache Directory Studio, JXplorer

## 📊 **Progress Summary**
- **Completed**: 1/10 tasks (10%)
- **In Progress**: 0/10 tasks  
- **Not Started**: 9/10 tasks (90%)

## 🎯 **Success Criteria for Phase 2**
- [ ] Full LDAP search operations work with ldapsearch using all scope types
- [ ] Complex LDAP filters work correctly (AND, OR, NOT operations)
- [ ] Schema validation prevents invalid directory entries
- [ ] LDIF files can be loaded to populate directory
- [ ] Proper LDAP error codes returned for invalid operations
- [ ] Compatible with popular LDAP browsers and administration tools

## 🔄 **Dependencies from Phase 1**
✅ **Basic server infrastructure** - Server and factory classes ready  
✅ **Storage backends** - Memory and JSON storage operational  
✅ **Simple authentication** - Foundation for advanced auth features  
✅ **Basic search operations** - Ready to extend with advanced features  

## 🚀 **Ready to Start**
Phase 1 completion provides a solid foundation. The next priority should be implementing advanced search operations with filter parsing, as this is core to LDAP functionality.

**Recommended Starting Point**: LDAP filter parsing and evaluation

**Status**: 🚧 **10% COMPLETE** - Ready for advanced search implementation
