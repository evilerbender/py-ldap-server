# Phase 3: Write Operations & Advanced Features - ⏳ **NOT STARTED**

## 🎯 **Phase 3 Goals**
Support directory modifications, advanced authentication, multi-backend storage, and security features to create an enterprise-ready LDAP server.

## 📋 **Todo List Status**

### ✏️ **Write Operations**
- [ ] **Add operation implementation** - Create new directory entries with validation
- [ ] **Modify operation implementation** - Update existing entry attributes
- [ ] **Delete operation implementation** - Remove entries with referential integrity
- [ ] **Write operation transaction support** - Ensure atomic operations and rollback

### 🔐 **Advanced Authentication**  
- [ ] **UPN-style authentication (Active Directory compatibility)** - Support user@domain.com format
- [ ] **Access control and authorization** - Implement LDAP access control policies
- [ ] **LDAPS (TLS) support** - Secure LDAP connections with certificates
- [ ] **Certificate management** - TLS certificate generation and rotation

### 🗄️ **Multi-Backend Storage**
- [ ] **Storage backend abstraction** - Common interface for all storage types
- [ ] **File-based storage backend** - Persistent file storage beyond JSON
- [ ] **Database storage backend** - SQL database integration (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- [ ] **Storage backend configuration** - Runtime backend selection and switching

### ⚡ **Performance & Optimization**
- [ ] **Performance optimizations** - Query optimization and connection pooling
- [ ] **Comprehensive test suite** - Integration tests for all write operations

## 📊 **Progress Summary**
- **Completed**: 0/14 tasks (0%)
- **In Progress**: 0/14 tasks  
- **Not Started**: 14/14 tasks (100%)

## 🎯 **Success Criteria for Phase 3**
- [ ] Can add, modify, and delete directory entries via LDAP
- [ ] Write operations are atomic and handle errors gracefully
- [ ] UPN authentication works for Active Directory compatibility
- [ ] TLS connections secure LDAP communications
- [ ] Multiple storage backends can be configured and used
- [ ] Compatible with PAM/SSSD for system authentication
- [ ] Performance suitable for moderate directory sizes (1000+ entries)

## 🔄 **Dependencies from Previous Phases**
❓ **Phase 2 completion required** - Advanced search and schema validation needed first  
✅ **Basic authentication** - Foundation ready for UPN and TLS features  
✅ **Storage infrastructure** - Ready to extend with additional backends  

## 🚀 **Preparation Notes**
Phase 3 represents a significant leap in functionality, adding write capabilities and enterprise features. This phase will require:

- **LDAP Message Handlers**: Extending the server to handle Add/Modify/Delete requests
- **Transaction Management**: Ensuring data integrity during write operations  
- **Security Infrastructure**: TLS certificates and access control policies
- **Storage Abstraction**: Clean interfaces to support multiple backend types

**Recommended Starting Point**: Add operation implementation after Phase 2 completion

**Status**: ⏳ **NOT STARTED** - Blocked by Phase 2 dependencies
